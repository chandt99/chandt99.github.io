    <h3>IMF Total Lending</h3>
    <p>The first chart exhibits the total IMF credit outstanding for members between 1984-2022 in SDRs (billions).</p>
    <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>
    <p> This appears to show recent years as having the highest absolute values of outstanding IMF loans over the last 30 years, suggesting high risk and instability in the global economy.
        
        On first viewing, the graph shows that we are living at a time where the absolute value of outstanding IMF loans is the highest it has been in the past 30 years, suggesting high risk and instability in the global economy.
        However, this absolute value does not take in to account the overall growth in global GDP over the last 30 years; for a true assessment of risk in the global economy, the data should be adjusted for global GDP.
    </p>

    <h3>IMF Total Lending Adjusted for GDP</h3>
        <p>The second chart has adjusted this data to account for the rise in Global GDP to show the IMF outstanding loan value as a percentage of Global GDP.
            Years with the highest percentage of IMF outstanding loan to global GDP suggest higher risk in the global economy.</p> 
           <p><span class="emphasized">Note: both IMF outstanding loan value and global GDP have been converted to current US Doillar values.</span></p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart4"> </div>

<script>
        //Define charts:
        var myChart3 = "IMF";
        var myChart4 = "IMF GDP";
    
        // Embed charts:
        vegaEmbed('#Chart3', myChart3);
        vegaEmbed('#Chart4', myChart4);
</script>
    
<p>Conclusion: 1984 is the 'riskiest' year while 2007 is the least; 'risk' here is defined as when outstanding loans represents the largest proportion of global GDP.</p>
