				<h2>The UK Music Industry as a Growth Contributor</h2>
			</div>
			<p>A collection of exogenous shocks has left the UK music industry precariously placed; COVID-19 stifled demand, Brexit increased export barriers, and the government has slashed arts funding.
        
                This data exploration will examine the UK music industry's significance to the economy and its potential as a growth contributor. This is particularly important as the government looks to reform education; highlighting the economic significance of the industry has the prospect of shifting the narrative away from arts funding as unproductive, towards it as a worthy investment.

                <p>Figure 1 shows the Gross Value Added to the UK economy of arts sectors and for all the UK between 2019-2022 (COVID-19). Despite dropping to the lowest of all sectors to 37% of its 2019 value, the music sector has seen the strongest recovery, now comparatively producing at well above the UK index.</p>

        <h3>Streaming</h3>
        <p>With streaming the dominant aspect of the industry, Figure 5 is a bubble chart plotting a country's GDP/capita against its music streaming penetration rate. There appears to be a somewhat strong correlation between the two variables; <a href="https://vega.github.io/editor/#/url/vega-lite/N4IgJAzgxgFgpgWwIYgFwhgF0wBwqgegIDc4BzJAOjIEtMYBXAI0poHsDp5kTykBaADZ04JAKyUAVhDYA7EABoQAEySYUqUAwBOgtBmx5CBbUgDu1OoyYMIcbVDmY4szJUcICsJLOWYAnP5eMD5+gZb0zKwcyDSyBACyAMoACgBKAKQATAAMAOIAIikpAMIAjO4QxCAAvkqCSACe9mgA2qDI2gDWaKCYjThw+jhscZiKIABmNIKCcMpomNoMcHUgLo7KcWS9IAAeu9NwggvoyekABAAUGQCUE-2D+gCODD6YdGo0pLVKjYc0Y6nECFYolB4DIboV7vT4fH41REKDpIbq7R5QkDCWRDJSOQRsbT6abaOBMbQ0KA9NZLHwQSaEhBtUCksikiAQdjydCg0oTOT6c5pa53WoAXSUGzYW1kO00+wBQMFqWFN3uSgxLzerjh3yGa3+8qOJ30vPBGshWth6nh+qRfVMsnpjOZIFZ7M5Ap5RT5Si9ICFIvVIBwqKQCAgi2Wq2RICgSEEUAYDWc+gA5GkAE2oC5pgDUDO0yEwV1UmAYCEo2iSMNJygUucoWUmaeDSEj6DSWXFSk6PXlmvQzj24zxbAJRPQJLJFKpEwO6DMND8MAmCZoZG5bo3WAmhv4YjWUplcr6cBH6Mt6FkbAQcQTE2NwK7tURYpqQA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">regressing these produces an R statistic of 0.6</a>.

            <h3>Live Performances: Microeconomic Impact</h3>
            <p>Using Google mobility data, Figure 6 shows changes in retail activity in London boroughs from a pre-pandemic baseline on days where live music was played at Wembley Stadium. Here, we can see values well above the other London Boroughs and the Brent baseline, suggesting hightened economic activity due to music events (although correlation isn't causation). To contextualise this, the heat map below shows every data point in the Google dataset, with these Wembley dates producing some of the highest single-day increases during the pandemic. This suggests the positive microeconomic effect of live music for communities during COVID-19 recovery.</p>

            <h3>Intangible Impact: Life Satisfaction</h3>
            <p>To see if music is correlated with improved life quality (suggesting it as a positive externality), Figure 8 attempts to see if listening to more music as a country is correlated to life satisfaction. Streaming penetration data is taken as a proxy for the amount of music a country listens to. There is little correlation.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            Performing well above the UK average following COVID recovery and increasingly exporting to emerging music markets has suggested the industry as growing and worthy of investment. The UK is at the forefront of the dominant streaming market, opening the possibility for further development in this field. Finally, there is some evidence of the importance of live music to local economies, showing macroeconomic <span class="emphasized">and</span> microeconomic value. The Google Mobility dataset offers the possibility of further research. With greater resources, a more complete study could catalogue the effect of live music throughout London, conducting a diff-in-diff experiment comparing activity on live music days to non-music days to quantify the added local value.             </p>
